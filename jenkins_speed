#Jenkins solution to speed issue

To ensure that the <jenkinsUrl> value is updated automatically when you stop and start the server again,
you can create a script that performs the update and then configure it to run as part of the server 
startup process.

Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:

1. Create a script that contains the command to update the <jenkinsUrl> value. Let's name this script 
update_jenkins_url.sh:

#!/bin/bash

sudo -u jenkins sed -i "/^  <jenkinsUrl>/c\  <jenkinsUrl>$(curl -s ifconfig.me):8080</jenkinsUrl>" 
/var/lib/jenkins/jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.xml

2. Make the script executable:

chmod +x update_jenkins_url.sh

3. Configure the script to run automatically on server startup. You can do this by adding the script to 
the server's startup process. One common way to do this on Linux systems is by adding the script to 
the /etc/rc.local file.

Edit the /etc/rc.local file:

sudo vi /etc/rc.local

Add the following line to the end of the file 

/path/to/update_jenkins_url.sh

Replace /path/to/update_jenkins_url.sh with the actual path to your script.

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

5. Ensure that the script will be executed during boot.

sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local


Now, whenever the server is started, the script update_jenkins_url.sh will be executed automatically,
updating the <jenkinsUrl> value in the Jenkins configuration file.
